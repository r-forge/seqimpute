Description: Imputation of missing data present in a dataset through the prediction based on either a random forest or a multinomial, a linear or an ordinal regression model. Covariates and time-dependant covariates can be included in the model. The prediction of the missing values is based on the theory of Prof. Brendan Halpin.
