Description: Multiple imputation of missing data present in a dataset through the prediction based on either a random forest or a multinomial regression model. Covariates and time-dependant covariates can be included in the model. The prediction of the missing values is based on the method of Halpin (2012) <https://researchrepository.ul.ie/articles/report/Multiple_imputation_for_life-course_sequence_data/19839736>.
